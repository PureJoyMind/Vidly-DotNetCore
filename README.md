Movie rental ASP.NET Core MVC application made in mosh hamedani's asp.net framework course.
The course was old so I learnt .NET Core and Entity Framework Core and applied it to the project myself.

# Features
* CRUD oprations in MVC
* Web APIs to send data to view in .NET core
* Authentication and Authorization of users
* Different roles in a system with access levels
* Connection to the database with Entity Framework Core
