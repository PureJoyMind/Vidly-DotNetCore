# Vidly
Movie rental ASP.NET Core MVC application made in mosh hamedani's asp.net framework course.
The course was old and using a deprecated framework so I learnt .NET Core and Entity Framework Core and applied it to the project myself. 
His course was just a roadmap to show me which topics to study next and also tought some real world project perspective to me.

* Web APIs to send data to view in .NET core
* Authentication and Authorization of users
* Different roles in a system with access levels
* Connection to the database using ***Code First*** approach with Entity Framework Core
